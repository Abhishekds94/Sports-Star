## Future Scope
Below are a few of the ideas that I could think of to enhance the application,
* Add notifications to notify user on match days of selected teams
* Add offline compatibility using Room and LiveData
* Adding [Interstitial ads](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/android/interstitial) to monetize the app
* Add Live scores feature with premium API
